		<h1>Intro to Music Theory</h1>
		<p>Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. The Oxford Companion to Music describes three interrelated uses of the term "music theory":

The first is what is otherwise called "rudiments", currently taught as the elements of notation, of key signatures, of time signatures, of rhythmic notation, and so on. The second is the study of writings about music from ancient times onwards. The third is an area of current musicological study that seeks to define processes and general principles in music—a sphere of research that can be distinguished from analysis in that it takes as its starting-point not the individual work or performance but the fundamental materials from which it is built.

Music theory is frequently concerned with describing how musicians and composers make music, including tuning systems and composition methods among other topics. Because of the ever-expanding conception of what constitutes music (see Definition of music), a more inclusive definition could be that music theory is the consideration of any sonic phenomena, including silence, as they relate to music. This is not an absolute guideline; for example, the study of "music" in the Quadrivium liberal arts university curriculum that was common in medieval Europe was an abstract system of proportions that was carefully studied at a distance from actual musical practice. However, this medieval discipline became the basis for tuning systems in later centuries, and it is generally included in modern scholarship on the history of music theory.

Music theory as a practical discipline encompasses the methods and concepts composers and other musicians use in creating music. The development, preservation, and transmission of music theory in this sense may be found in oral and written music-making traditions, musical instruments, and other artifacts. For example, ancient instruments from Mesopotamia, China, and prehistoric sites around the world reveal details about the music they produced and potentially something of the musical theory that might have been used by their makers (see History of music and Musical instrument). In ancient and living cultures around the world, the deep and long roots of music theory are clearly visible in instruments, oral traditions, and current music making. Many cultures, at least as far back as ancient Mesopotamia and ancient China, have also considered music theory in more formal ways such as written treatises and music notation. Practical and scholarly traditions overlap, as many practical treatises about music place themselves within a tradition of other treatises, which are cited regularly just as scholarly writing cites earlier research.

In modern academia, music theory is a subfield of musicology, the wider study of musical cultures and history. Etymologically, music theory is an act of contemplation of music, from the Greek θεωρία, a looking at, viewing, contemplation, speculation, theory, also a sight, a spectacle. As such, it is often concerned with abstract musical aspects such as tuning and tonal systems, scales, consonance and dissonance, and rhythmic relationships, but there is also a body of theory concerning practical aspects, such as the creation or the performance of music, orchestration, ornamentation, improvisation, and electronic sound production.[6] A person who researches, teaches, or writes articles about music theory is a music theorist. University study, typically to the MA or PhD level, is required to teach as a tenure-track music theorist in a US or Canadian university. Methods of analysis include mathematics, graphic analysis, and especially analysis enabled by Western music notation. Comparative, descriptive, statistical, and other methods are also used. Music theory textbooks, especially in the United States of America, often include elements of musical acoustics, considerations of musical notation, and techniques of tonal composition (harmony and counterpoint), among other topics.</p>
		<h2>Intervals</h2>
		<p>In music theory, an interval is the difference in pitch between two sounds. An interval may be described as horizontal, linear, or melodic if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and vertical or harmonic if it pertains to simultaneously sounding tones, such as in a chord.

In Western music, intervals are most commonly differences between notes of a diatonic scale. The smallest of these intervals is a semitone. Intervals smaller than a semitone are called microtones. They can be formed using the notes of various kinds of non-diatonic scales. Some of the very smallest ones are called commas, and describe small discrepancies, observed in some tuning systems, between enharmonically equivalent notes such as C♯ and D♭. Intervals can be arbitrarily small, and even imperceptible to the human ear.</p>
		<h2>Chords</h2>
		<p>A chord, in music, is any harmonic set of pitches consisting of multiple notes (also called "pitches") that are heard as if sounding simultaneously. For many practical and theoretical purposes, arpeggios and broken chords (in which the notes of the chord are sounded one after the other, rather than simultaneously), or sequences of chord tones, may also be considered as chords.

Chords and sequences of chords are frequently used in modern West African and Oceanic music, Western classical music, and Western popular music; yet, they are absent from the music of many other parts of the world.

In tonal Western classical music (music with a tonic key or "home key"), the most frequently encountered chords are triads, so called because they consist of three distinct notes: the root note, and intervals of a third and a fifth above the root note. Chords with more than three notes include added tone chords, extended chords and tone clusters, which are used in contemporary classical music, jazz and other genres.</p>

			<h1> About</h1>
			<p>MUSICADEMY is your web service for improving your musical perception skills as a Musician of any level! We offer plenty
			of resources: both theory and, specially, drills for you to develop your musical ear. <br><br>
			How different would your musical practice be if you developed your hearing skills? Much is sad about having absolute pitch in music.
			an almost mythical inate ability to instantly identify any pitch and their combination. Now what is much less talked about is
			the skill of having relative pitch, the skill to know the notes in relation to one another, a skill which can actually be developed
			through practice and which opens many doors to a musician, we aim to help you develop that very skill through a series of personalized exercises.
			</p>
			<h1> The Exercises</h1>
			<p>MUSICADEMY works on a hands-on method, so the focus really is on the exercises found in the practice section. In these perception exercises, you will first hear a short soundbite, either a chord or an interval and then identify what was just played</p>
			<h1> Intervals</h1>
			<p>the practice will begin with exercises on indentifying intervals, such as perfect octaves, major and minor thirds and so on. These exercises
			will feature ascending, descending and simultaneous playing of these intervals, although the student will not be asked to identify how they were played>
			<h1> Chords </h1>
			<p>in the chords portion of the the student will be asked to identify the types of chords (major,minor, diminished, with seventh and so on), multiple 
			inversions of the same chords might be played but the inversion used is not asked. You can read more on chords in the <a href="#theory" rel="external">theory</a> section</p>
			<h1> Your Progress</h1>
			<p>by <a href="#login" rel="external">creating an account</a> you can track your musical perception progress and advance in your studies, as you advance you will be asked about more varied
			intervals and chords, the progression will be tied to your performance so you are always able to develop your skills.</p>
